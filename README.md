# Decentralized Freelance Marketplace

## Project Title
**DecentraLancer** - A Blockchain-Based Freelance Marketplace

## Project Description
DecentraLancer is a decentralized freelance marketplace built on the Ethereum blockchain that connects clients with freelancers without intermediaries. The platform uses smart contracts to automate project management, payment processing, and dispute resolution, ensuring transparency, security, and fair treatment for all parties.

The smart contract handles the complete freelance workflow: project creation with escrow deposits, freelancer assignment, work submission, payment release, and dispute resolution. All transactions are transparent and immutable on the blockchain, providing trust and accountability in freelance relationships.
